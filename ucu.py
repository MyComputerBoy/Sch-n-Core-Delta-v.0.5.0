"""ucu.py -> Updated Control Unit or Schön Core Delta v.0.5.0 python emulator

Works with binary words defined as a list of ints, example:
[1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0]
Registers are defined as lists of words, and all types of registers are defined together in a list of registers,
but referencing them they're defined as [index,type]

Major functions:

initialize_rom() -> initializes Read Only Memory by reading file given at "rom/fn.txt" and writes the data to rom_data
reg(rw, index, reg_type, value=None, preset=None) -> Handles register read/write
rar(rw, index, reg_type, value=None) -> Handles register associated register

alu() -> executes arithmetic and logic operations based on flags set and registers

cls(r=0, g=0, b=0) -> clears registers and flags
execute(set_list, ena_list, gui=False, reg_a=[0,0], reg_b=[0,0], reg_c=[0,0]) -> Executes actions based on set/enable flags and registers
single_instruction(r=0, gui=False, print_line_nr=False, force_show_exceptions=False) -> Runs a single instruction
run(filename, gui=False, print_line_nr=False, force_show_exceptions=False,time_runtime=False) -> Function to call for running a schonexe5 file
